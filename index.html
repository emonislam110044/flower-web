        <h2 id="yello_color">What's in a name?</h2>
        <p id="pra_color">Flowers are a universal language, with cultures worldwide attributing special meanings to the
            way they're
            gifted,
            arranged and even displayed in your home. Floriography, the art of using bouquets and blooms to express your
            feelings, adds another layer of confusion to the wonder of florals but perhaps the most common
            misunderstanding
            comes from every day versus scientific naming of our favourite blossoms.

            Flowers with names generally have more than one we use to refer to them by, but florists and fans alike
            often
            use their common monikers - after all, how many times have you been the recipient of a lovely bunch of
            dianthus?
            You might be surprised: that's the scientific name of the carnation, one of the nation's favourite flowering
            plants.

            We've explored your most popular picks for bouquets to discover the differences between the scientific and
            common names for these famous flowers - you might be surprised to discover the origins of your must-have
            blooms!

            <h1 class="heading_aling">Scientific Name: Rosa</h1>
            <p class="pra_size">Perhaps the most famous flower on the list, the beautiful rose has attained cultural
                significance around
                the world and is often used to symbolise love, affection and beauty.</p>

            <p class="pra_size">Tall, majestic and strikingly-shaped: lilies are a popular choice for bouquets due to
                their
                unusual shape
                and scent. Like roses, lilies are an important cultural and literary device and are known throughout the
                temperature Northern Hemisphere for their beauty and resilience</p>

            <h1 class="heading_aling">Scientific Name: Phalaenopsis</h1>
            <p class="pra_size">Here's one you'd never have guessed! What we commonly call an orchid is actually known
                as a
                phalaenopsis,
                which is the cultivated flower of choice from the family of plants known as Orchidaceae. There are over
                28,000 species of orchid family plants, but the phalaenopsis covers about 60 of those and is mainly
                native to Southern Asia and Queensland.</p>

            <h1 id="headind_last">Tulip</h1>
            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Tulipa</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">Closely related to the lily and with a long history of cultivation at Latitude 40° North
                - an area
                spanning Ukraine and Turkey along with the Caspian Sea and even all the way to China - tulips have been
                seen as a symbol of wealth and abundance through the ages.

                Now closely associated with Springtime and Easter, they're known in Turkish as lale, a term which when
                written in Arabic letters shares the same characters as 'Allah', resulting in the flower becoming a holy
                symbol in many Middle Eastern cultures.</p>

            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Dianthus</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">Just like we mentioned above, the humble dianthus is one of the UK's favourite flowering
                plants, and it's
                mainly native to Europe and Asia which explains our long-standing fascination with this hardy plant.

                There's a theory that the colour "pink" may be named after the and the frilly edges of its petals; the
                verb "to pink" means to decorate with a perforated pattern, and shows up around the same time as the
                colour began to be used in English.</p>

            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Freesia</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">What we call freesias are actually cultivated hybrids of a number of flowers in the
                Freesia family, and
                that’s why we refer to them as their scientific name. Unlike many of the other entries in this list,
                these beautiful trumpet-like blooms aren’t named after something in Latin or Greek, but take their name
                from botanist and doctor Friedrich Freese.</p>

            <h1 id="headind_last">Hyacinth</h1>
            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Alstroemeria</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">Finding their home along the warm eastern Mediterranean, hyacinths are often confused
                with the
                similar-looking muscari flower, another blue-budded plant which grows clusters of flowers along its
                stem.

                In the UK we often gift hyacinth bulbs at the beginning of Spring or around Easter time: this is derived
                from the Persian custom of using a flowering hyacinth to decorate the table around the time of the
                Persian New Year, which happens at the Spring Equinox.

            <h1 id="headind_last">Peruvian Lily</h1>
            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Alstroemeria</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">No surprises in guessing where this flower comes from; the alstroemeria is almost
                exclusively found in
                South America, with two distinct varieties centred in Chile and Brazil which flower in winter and summer
                respectively. The scientific name comes from the Swedish baron Clas Alströmer who was a close friend of
                the legendary father of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus, proving that it pays to have famous friends!</p>

            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Chrysanthemum</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">A flower with many meanings, the chrysanthemum is found mainly in East Asia and has
                great significance
                for Chinese, Japanese and Korean cultures where it can symbolise everything from grief and adversity to
                representing the Japanese Imperial Family.

                A highly seasonal flower, chrysanthemums are one of the "Four Gentlemen" in China where they represent
                autumn and graceful nobility.</p>

            <h1 id="headind_last">Gladiolus</h1>
            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Gladiolus</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">WHere's where flowers with names can get complicated: the gladiolus is part of the Iris
                family of plants
                but is commonly called the "sword lily" due to its long, thin trumpet reminiscent of true lilies. The
                scientific name comes from the Latin for sword, gladius.

                They're associated with 40th wedding anniversaries, so a bouquet with red gladioli included would
                definitely go down well with a couple celebrating their Ruby wedding.</p>

            <h2 id="headind_last">Scientific Name: Anemone</h2>
            <p class="pera_all">A temperate-loving flower with a sturdy construction and tendency towards vibrant,
                long-lasting flowers,
                anemones are also called "wind flowers", a name derived from their scientific namesakes, the Greek gods
                Anemoi who ruled over the winds.

                In classical literature, anemones were created when the goddess Venus sprinkled nectar on the blood of
                her dead lover Adonis.</p>
